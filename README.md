# google-homepage
* So far, I have completed the freeCodeCamp.org basic HTML and CSS course.
* My project is to clone the Google home page.
* Opted to build with CSS Flexbox. In retrospect, I could have just positioned the header and footer absolutely and used media queries because thatâ€™s where all the meaningful responsiveness comes from as is.
* Media queries were used, but the mobile layout is still lackluster. This needs more investigation.
* In retrospect, I could have spruced up the aesthetics of the buttons and search box and could have added more images.
* [This](https://ndmekala.github.io/google-homepage) is the live preview.

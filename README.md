# google-homepage
* So far, I have completed the freeCodeCamp.org basic HTML and CSS course.
* My project is to clone the Google home page.
* Opted to build with CSS Flexbox. In retrospect, I could have just positioned the header and footer absolutely and used media queries because that’s where all the meaningful responsiveness comes from as is.
* ~~Media queries were used, but the mobile layout is still lackluster. This needs more investigation.~~
* After thinking about this more, the mobile layout scaled the text down too small and the Google image header scaled with width of the window which made it too small. If I revisit this project, I’d fix these to improve appearance.
* In retrospect, I could have spruced up the aesthetics of the buttons and search box and could have added more images.
* [This](https://ndmekala.github.io/google-homepage) is the live preview.

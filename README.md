*Cloning the Google homepage for The Odin Project*
* So far, I have completed the freeCodeCamp.org basic HTML and CSS course.
* My project is to clone the Google home page.
* Opted to build with CSS Flexbox. In retrospect, I could have just positioned the header and footer absolutely.
* Media queries were used, but the mobile layout is still lackluster. This needs more investigation.
* The search box is just a dummy.
